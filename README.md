# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
My client for this project was Artemis Financial. They are a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their clients. The issue they wanted me to address was to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. They were wanting to modernize their operations by updating the security software on their RESTful web API.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I think something that I did well when identifying their software security vulnerabilities was my use of the dependency check. It's important to code securely because as software becomes more advanced and more widely used, the amount of malicious attacks also increases. Secure coding can help prevent some of the malicious attacks and give the customers confidence that their data is well proteced. Software security adds a lot of value to a company's welleing because it helps build a trustworthy relationship between the company and the clients. 

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I found the most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was developing the mitigation plan. I wasn't very confident in my understand on how to address the different issues I found in the dependency check. 

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
