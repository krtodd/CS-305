# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
My client for this project was Artemis Financial. They are a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their clients. The issue they wanted me to address was to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. They were wanting to modernize their operations by updating the security software on their RESTful web API.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I think something that I did well when identifying their software security vulnerabilities was my use of the dependency check. It's important to code securely because as software becomes more advanced and more widely used, the amount of malicious attacks also increases. Secure coding can help prevent some of the malicious attacks and give the customers confidence that their data is well proteced. Software security adds a lot of value to a company's welleing because it helps build a trustworthy relationship between the company and the clients. 

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I found the most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was developing the mitigation plan. I wasn't very confident in my understand on how to address the different issues I found in the dependency check. 

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
In order to increase the layers of security, I first analyzed what funtionality Artemis Financial wanted out of their application. Then, I manually reviewed the code to located any issues with security within the application they were using. Finally, I refactored the code as I saw fit in order to meet their security requirements. One techniqe that I would use in the future is the dependency check tool. I found this tool to be extremely helpful because it showed all the possible vulnerabilities that existed in the program.

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensured that the code was functional and secure by following the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram (VAPFD). This helped guide me in my goal to produce secure and functional code because I followed each step to ensure that the code met the security requirements. After refactoring the code, I checked to see if it introduced new vulnerabilities by running another dependency check. This helped show me whether my refactored code had produced any new security issues.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
One tool that I used that I think could be helpful in future assignments is generating my own certificate of authentication. I feel that this will be useful in future projects because I will more easily be able to generate my own certificates to create RESTful applications.'


# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
From this project, I would most likely showcase my ability to generate a checksum verification. I found this task fairly difficult when I first attemped it, however, after spending some time working through the issues I encountered, I was able to successfully generate a checksum verification that converted a piece of data into hex decimal form.
